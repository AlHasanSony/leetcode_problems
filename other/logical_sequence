# problem 

# Write an program that reads two numbers X and Y (X < Y). After this, show a sequence of 1 to y, passing to the next line to each X numbers.

# Input
# The input contains two integer numbers X (1 < X < 20) and Y (X < Y < 100000).

# Output
# Each sequence must be printed in one line, with a blank space between each number, like the following example.

# Input Sample	Output Sample
# 3 99

# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9
# 10 11 12
# ...
# 97 98 99



x, y = map(int, input().split())

while count < (y//x):
    start = count*x + 1
    end = (count + 1) * x + 1
    for i in range(start,end,1):
        print(i,end=" ")
    print("")
    count+=1
